In statistics, we are interested in making an inference about population parameters. We set and test hypotheses about the population. 

---

class: middle

## Goals

- Learn to write hypotheses in words.
- Learn to write hypotheses using notation.


---

class:center middle

null means zero(which represents nothingness)


---

## Research Question

Are there any pink cows in the world?

---

class: middle 

## Hypotheses

**Null** hypothesis: There are __no__ pink cows in the world.  

**Alternative** hypothesis: There is a pink cow in the world.

---

class: middle 

## Hypothesis Testing Procedure

We go looking for evidence to against the null. 

- If we find any evidence against the null (a single pink cow) then we can conclude null is false. We say we **reject the null** hypothesis.

- If we do not find any evidence against the null (a single pink cow) then **we fail to reject the null**. We can keep searching for more evidence against the null (i.e. continue looking for a pink cow). We will never be able to say the null is true so we never accept the null. All we can do is keep looking for a pink cow.

## Research Question

Are there any black cows in the world?

---

class: middle 

## Hypotheses

**Null** hypothesis: There are __no__ black cows in the world.

**Alternative** hypothesis: There are is a black cow in the world.


---

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width="40%"}
library(emojifont)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot() + geom_emoji("cow", color='black') + theme_void()
```

When we see a black cow, we **reject** the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a black cow in the world.

## Research Question

Is there a foreign object in the cat's body?


---

class: middle

## Hypothesis Testing

**Null** hypothesis: There is __no__ foreign object in the cat's body.

**Alternative** hypothesis: There are is a foreign object in the cat's body.

---

class: center middle

## Collect Evidence

X-ray

---
class: middle 

## Conclusion and Decision


X-ray does not show any foreign object. 


- Fail to reject the null hypothesis.
- We __cannot__ conclude the null hypothesis is true. We __cannot__ accept the null hypothesis.

---

class: middle 

## Example


**Null** hypothesis: There is **no** problem with my cell phone.

**Alternative** hypothesis: There is a problem with my cell phone.

---

class: middle

## Collect Evidence

- Check if the screen is broken.

--

- Check if the battery life is too short.

--

- Check if the response times of apps are long.

--

- ...

---

class: middle

## Conclusion and Decision

No problems were detected.

- Fail to reject the null hypothesis. 

--

- You __cannot__ conclude that there is no problem with the cell phone.

--

- You can state that there were no problems detected (i.e. there was no evidence against the null).

---
class: middle

## Remember

- Null hypothesis is always about nothing: **no** pink cow, **no** effect, **no** difference etc.

--

- We __never__ accept the null hypothesis. We either reject it or fail to reject it.

--

- We always start a hypothesis test with the assumption that the null hypothesis is true and try to find evidence against it.

---

class: middle

## Null Hypothesis

It might be harder for us to see the null hypothesis being the "zero/no" case until we move things around. 

.pull-left[
$H_0 : \mu = 8$  
$H_A : \mu \neq 8$
]

.pull-right[
$H_0 : \mu - 8 = 0$  
$H_A : \mu - 8 \neq 0$  
]


---

## Side Note

If you write HA and H0 to refer to null and alternative hypotheses on Gradescope when you type, we will understand what you are referring to.

--

If you want to type it out correctly as $H_0$ and $H_A$ then you can write 

```{r eval = FALSE}
$$H_0$$
$$H_A$$
```

The double dollar signs at the beginning and at the end let Gradescope know that you are writing a math equation.

_ makes the preceding character a subscript.
